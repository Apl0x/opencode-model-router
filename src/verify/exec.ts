/**
 * The single process layer for verification: every command runs through
 * `runShell` (a shell string) or `runArgv` (argv, no shell), which share one
 * implementation of the deadline, abort, output cap and tree kill.
 *
 * `child_process.exec` with `timeout` (or `signal`) only signals the shell it
 * spawned. Test commands are process trees — `cmd /c npm test` -> npm -> vitest
 * -> one worker per core — so killing the shell orphans everything below it,
 * and the "aborted" baseline keeps every core busy until the suite finishes on
 * its own. On a timeout or abort this kills the whole tree instead: `taskkill
 * /T` on Windows, the process group on POSIX.
 *
 * Lifecycle guarantees (G4, docs/qa/verification-resource-budget/phase-1.2.md):
 * - The promise always resolves, never rejects, and settles at most
 *   KILL_GRACE_MS after a kill even when a descendant that escaped the kill
 *   still holds the output pipes (they are then force-closed).
 * - A deadline or abort that arrives after the direct child exited still
 *   reaches what it left running (POSIX: its process group; Windows: a
 *   creation-time-bounded sweep of its children, see `armSweeper`), without
 *   ever signalling a PID that may have been recycled.
 * - `timedOut` is true when the deadline or abort fired while something still
 *   held the run (the command, a descendant it left running, or the held
 *   pipes), so a kill was attempted. A case that cannot be told apart counts as
 *   a kill (fail-closed): on Windows, the grace settling the run while a sweep
 *   that pinned trees is still reporting, even if the leftover exited on its
 *   own during the grace (QA-1.2-24, QA-1.2-28). An abort that finds nothing
 *   left running is a no-op: the natural result stands.
 * - Runs still in flight when opencode exits are killed from one
 *   `process.once("exit")` hook: on POSIX their process groups (QA-1.2-6), on
 *   Windows the tree of each direct child that has not exited (QA-1.2-18).
 *   libuv's kill-on-close job does not do this on Windows: its job allows
 *   silent breakaway, so it holds only the processes libuv spawned itself. It
 *   ends the direct child (cmd.exe) but not the tree below it (npm, vitest).
 *   Not covered: death by an unhandled signal (the host's SIGTERM/SIGHUP/Ctrl-C
 *   policy), which skips `exit` hooks and remains opencode's concern, and on
 *   Windows what an already-exited direct child left running (only the sweep
 *   reaches that).

/**
 * Windows: find and kill what an exited child left running, without ever
 * targeting a recycled PID (QA-1.2-1). `taskkill /T` on the dead PID finds
 * nothing, and a recycled PID must never be targeted, so the processes are
 * found by their creation time instead:
 *
 * 1. Roots are processes whose ParentProcessId is the child's PID and whose
 *    creation time lies in [spawnedAt, exitedAt] (± clock slack). The child's
 *    PID stays bound to the child until libuv closes its handle, just before
 *    `exit` is emitted, so a process with that parent created in the window
 *    was created by the child; the children of a later owner of the PID are
 *    created after `exitedAt` and are excluded.
 * 2. Each root is pinned by an open handle and its start time re-checked, so
 *    its own PID cannot be recycled between the query and the kill.
 * 3. On `kill`, each live root is ended with `taskkill /T /F` (its tree). A
 *    pinned root that exited meanwhile is swept the same way, using its exact
 *    lifetime as the window.
 *
 * Descendants whose parent died before being pinned (a detached grandchild of
 * a short-lived middle process) cannot be attributed safely; the kill grace
 * period bounds the run in that case.
 *
 * The sweeper is Windows PowerShell 5.1 (always installed; pwsh 7 is not, and
 * wmic is gone from current Windows 11) at normal priority, spawned directly —
 * not through `run` — with its own kill timeout; every failure degrades to
 * "nothing killed". The script is passed with single quotes only, so Node's
 * argument quoting cannot alter it.
 *
 * It needs PowerShell in FullLanguage mode: under Constrained Language Mode
 * (AppLocker/WDAC) the .NET calls it relies on fail, so it exits 3 at once.
 * After pinning it prints `pinned <n>`. When a kill was requested and that
 * marker is missing (spawn error, non-zero exit, no marker, or the
 * SWEEP_TIMEOUT_MS limit), `kill` reports why, and the run appends
 * `[orphan sweep unavailable: <reason>]` to stderr if it has not settled yet
 * (QA-1.2-15). A failure after the run settled has no result to report to.
