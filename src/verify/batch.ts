// src/verify/batch.ts
// S5 batching coordinator (plan Phase 2.2). The header below is the design of task 2.2.1; the
// pure helpers (2.2.2.b) and createBatchCoordinator (2.2.2.c, 2.2.2.d) implement it.
//
// ===============================================================================================
// BATCHING COORDINATOR: design (plan Phase 2.2, task 2.2.1)
//
// Consumes only the 2.1.1 contract in src/verify/types.ts, block "testsPass pipeline contract"
// (cherry-picked from vrb/p21 as 5be8c85 and never edited here): Deadline, ScopedOutcome,
// RecheckOutcome, VerificationScope, OpenVerificationScope, TestsPassRequest, TestsPassRun,
// TestsPassHook. Runner facts come from src/verify/runner.ts sections G, H, I (step 2a), J and
// Q 2.2. The pipeline and the verdict algebra are specified in the "testsPass PIPELINE" header of
// src/verify/deterministic.ts (vrb/p21, 7cd793d), cited below as 2.1-T<n>. Plan: section 1.3 (S5),
// 1.4 (batchWindowMs), 1.5-13 (deadline), 1.5-18/19 (router_verify and background mode reuse this
// coordinator), Phase 2.2. Record: docs/qa/verification-resource-budget/phase-2.2.md.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B1. GOAL AND GUARANTEES
//
//   Concurrent testsPass checks that would run the same program with the same options become one
//   scoped run over the union of their changed files. Each requester still gets the TestsPassRun
//   it would have got running alone. hook(runtime) returns exactly a TestsPassHook, so 2.2.3 swaps
//   the coordinator in behind 2.1's direct hook with no signature change. router_verify (2.4.3)
//   and background mode (2.4.5) reach it through the same hook.
//
//   B-G1 Equivalence. Under a deterministic runner, with no deadline expiry and no slot
//        contention, each request's TestsPassRun judges (2.1-T5) to the same ok, the same
//        unverifiable and the same introduced/preexisting/unknown sets as the direct hook gives
//        that request alone (B12).
//   B-G2 Only toward caution. When the runner is not deterministic (flaky tests), the batch may
//        turn a would-be pass into unverifiable. It never turns anything into a pass (B7.5).
//   B-G3 One slot hold per batch (QA-1.4-18). Each batch opens one VerificationScope, once, and
//        holds it across the union run, the attribution runs and every recheck. Scopes are never
//        nested. A split batch opens none: it hands each member to a batch of its own (B5.6).
//   B-G4 A requester's own deadline bounds every step it waits for. One requester's expiry or
//        abort never cancels the batch for the others. When every requester is gone, the running
//        tree is killed.
//   B-G5 The hook never rejects (TestsPassHook contract). Any internal failure becomes a
//        ScopedOutcome "error" for the requests it affects (fail-closed, 2.1-T6 R8).
//   B-G6 State is bounded. No timer outlives its window, and nothing outlives dispose().
//   B-G7 Deadline pressure (QA-2.2-17). A batched request does not end weaker than it would with
//        batchWindowMs: 0 under the same budget, as far as a cheap estimate can ensure. By default
//        an unverifiable verdict is accepted with a caveat (strictUnverifiable off), so a batch
//        that turned a rejection into a deadline-induced unverifiable would weaken the gate. A
//        lone request never waits (W7). The window never eats into a member's reserve (W3). When
//        any member's budget cannot cover the batched schedule, every member runs alone, exactly
//        as its direct hook would (B5.2a, B5.6). Residuals: B15.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B2. BYPASSES (no window, no union), checked in this order on arrival
//
//   1. The coordinator is disposed -> { scoped: aborted BATCH_REASONS.disposed }.
//   2. request.testScope === "full" -> runtime.direct(request). The resolved command runs as
//      written (2.1-T2 P5f). It cannot be merged, and S6 forbids widening a scoped run into it.
//   3. runtime.batchWindowMs <= 0 -> runtime.direct(request). "batchWindowMs: 0 disables
//      batching": every request runs alone, still scoped.
//   4. plan = runtime.plan(request, request.deadline), that is, planScopedRun (B6). Then:
//        NoAffected    -> { scoped: { kind: "no-affected", note }, recheck: undefined }
//        Unverifiable  -> { scoped: { kind: "unverifiable", code, reason }, recheck: undefined }
//                         (S6; changedFiles "unavailable" lands here as attribution-unavailable)
//        rejection     -> { scoped: { kind: "error", reason }, recheck: undefined }
//      These are exactly 2.1-T2 P3: none of them takes the slot or waits for a window. Planning
//      comes first even when the deadline is already aborted, as in 2.1's direct hook, so those
//      requests get the same planning outcome as alone (QA-2.2-9).
//   5. ScopedSpec, but the coordinator was disposed meanwhile -> B2.1; the deadline is aborted ->
//      aborted BATCH_REASONS.beforeRun (2.1's ABORTED_BEFORE_RUN: its execute answers so with an
//      aborted deadline). Nothing is spawned.
//   6. ScopedSpec -> the request joins the window of batchKey(spec) (B3, B4).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B3. BATCH KEY
//
//   batchKey(spec) = JSON of [gitRoot, runner, entry, file, cwd, envSignature(spec.env),
//   argvTemplate(spec)], with every path folded to lower case on win32.
//     - gitRoot, runner, entry and envSignature (key-sorted JSON of spec.env) are the plan's key
//       (runner.ts Q 2.2).
//     - Three fields are added (deviation D1): file (node, or the native pytest/uv), cwd (the
//       runnerCwd, which is also the id key space, runner.ts I) and argvTemplate. Two commands
//       that resolve to the same entry can still differ in their kept arguments (-t, --project,
//       -k, -m), in the worker cap, or in pytest's pinned -c/--rootdir (runner.ts D.4). A union
//       run with one request's options would not be the run the other request gets alone (B-G1).
//     - argvTemplate(spec) = spec.args with every element equal to one of spec.inputs removed,
//       and every occurrence of spec.reportPath replaced by "<report>". Inputs are absolute and
//       canonical (runner.ts N.2), so they never collide with an option token.
//   Requests with equal keys run the same program, in the same directory, with the same options
//   and environment. Only their inputs differ.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B4. WINDOWS
//
//   W1 A window opens when the first request for a key finishes planning with a ScopedSpec. Its
//      close time is set at that moment: openedAt + batchWindowMs, using the opener's runtime
//      value. A config reload does not stretch a window that is already open. Each window has
//      exactly one timer. The wiring caps batchWindowMs at gateBudgetMs / 10 (QA-2.2-21), so the
//      window itself is never most of a gate's budget.
//   W2 The window closes at that time, or at once when it holds maxBatchSize requests
//      (BATCH_MAX_REQUESTS = 8 by default), whichever comes first. The close time never moves
//      later: arrivals do not push it back (no debounce). So a steady stream cannot keep a window
//      open, and no request waits in a window for longer than batchWindowMs (2.1-T3's bound for
//      the batch wait). This is the starvation bound. W3 and W7 only close it earlier.
//   W3 The reserve (QA-2.2-17 b, QA-2.2-24). A member's floor is its
//      runtime.recheckMinRemainingMs when it can recheck at all (failureRecheck on and a captured
//      reference), else 0, plus BATCH_RESERVE_MARGIN_MS (1 s: union planning and scheduling).
//      With e = the key's last measured run duration (0 before the first run of the key), the
//      window closes no later than the moment the member at arrival index k (0 for the first)
//      would be left with less than
//        floor + e x (2k + 1).
//      That is what the schedule after the close needs when the batch splits (B5.6) and the slot
//      is one: the k members that joined before it run and recheck first, then its own run, then
//      its recheck. Their direct hooks would have queued in that order too. QA-2.2-24: the former
//      reserve, floor + e for each member alone, let a window held open by W7's signal spend the
//      recheck of the second tight member. When a member joins, and when a run of the key is measured,
//      the close time moves earlier if needed (the timer is re-armed, still one per window), or
//      the window closes at once when that moment has passed. A joiner whose remaining() is
//      within its floor therefore closes the window at once, as the former W3 did for a joiner
//      that could not outlive the wait.
//   W4 At close, the window is removed from the key map before anything asynchronous happens. A
//      request for the same key that finishes planning later opens the NEXT window. "Later"
//      covers the whole life of the batch: planning its union, waiting for the slot, running,
//      rechecking. A running union is never extended; its inputs are fixed at close.
//   W5 A request whose deadline aborts while it waits in a window is settled at once with
//      aborted BATCH_REASONS.window, and removed. A window left empty clears its timer and is
//      deleted.
//   W6 Batches for different keys (roots, runners, templates) are independent. Each opens its
//      own scope and competes for the machine-wide slot like any other verification, so they run
//      in parallel only as far as maxConcurrentVerifications allows. Two batches for the SAME
//      key (window N running, window N+1 closed) are just as independent, and serialize on the
//      slot when there is only one.
//   W7 Idle close (QA-2.2-17 a, QA-2.2-18). When no request is planning (between its arrival and
//      its window or planning outcome) and no batch is running, nothing can join an open window
//      and the slot is free, so every open window closes at once. It is checked when a request
//      joins, when a planning ends without a spec, and when a batch ends or is evicted. A lone
//      request therefore pays no window latency: its window closes as it joins, and it runs as
//      the direct path (B5.1). Requests that arrive while a batch runs gather in the next window,
//      which closes when that batch ends, at its timer, or by W2/W3 (group commit: under one slot
//      they would have waited for it anyway). The signal is the coordinator's own. The wiring
//      cannot see a gate that has not reached testsPass yet without index.ts and 2.4 bracketing
//      every gate, so concurrent gates batch when they reach testsPass together or while another
//      batch runs. BatchCoordinatorOptions.idleClose: false keeps only the timed close, for the
//      tests of W1-W6.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B5. BATCH RUN SEQUENCE
//
//   At close, with members M (in arrival order) and the batch deadline D (B9):
//   1. |M| = 1: skip steps 2a and 2. Step 4 runs the member's own spec with the member's own
//      deadline. Steps 5 and 7 have nothing to do, and step 8 is a single-member recheck. This is
//      exactly the direct path.
//   2a. Deadline check (QA-2.2-17 c, QA-2.2-23, QA-2.2-25), before union planning. Take the
//      members in deadline order, and e and each member's floor as in W3. The batch pools only
//      when every member's remaining() is at least
//        floor + e x (2n + i),
//      where n is the number of members and i the member's index. That sum is the worst case of
//      the batched schedule ahead of its recheck: the union (n x e), every member's own run (mode
//      B; a member can be held until the last of them, B5.7) and one recheck for each member
//      ahead of it. Otherwise the batch splits (step 6), and every member runs alone.
//      QA-2.2-25: the union is priced at n runs, never at one. It runs each of the members'
//      related test files once, where their own runs run each at least once; e itself is usually
//      one member's own run, and the union's run grows with its inputs. The check repeats after
//      union planning (step 2) and once the hold is taken (step 3), the schedule's two unmeasured
//      parts, and both are bounded by the time the check has left: past it, the members split.
//      QA-2.2-23: 9ed2abb instead ran the short members first inside the batch's scope. The
//      scope's first execute takes its one hold, and 2.1's scope reports a failed hold attempt to
//      every later call at once (P4). So a short member's cut slot wait became slot-busy for every
//      other member, including members with a minute left. No member now runs in a scope whose
//      hold another member's deadline decides: a pooled scope's first execute is the union under
//      D, and a split member's scope is its own.
//      Before the first measured run of a key, e is 0 and only the floor counts (a residual,
//      B15).
//   2. Union planning (B6): runtime.plan({ command and cwd of the first member, changedFiles:
//      unionChangedFiles(M) }, D'), where D' is D cut off when step 2a's check would fail
//      (QA-2.2-25). The batch splits (step 6) in four cases: the result is not a ScopedSpec;
//      batchKey(unionSpec) differs from the batch key; its inputs are not exactly the union of
//      the members' inputs (set equality on platform keys); or step 2a's check fails afterwards.
//   3. scope = runtime.openScope({ cwd, command }) of the first member. It is opened once, and
//      every execute and rechecker below goes through it (B10). QA-2.2-25: when the scope has
//      hold() (2.1's scopes do), the batch takes the hold first, under D' again, and repeats step
//      2a's check once it holds the slot. A hold not taken in time, or a failed check, closes the
//      scope and splits. The union's execute then reuses the hold (2.1's scope memoizes its one
//      hold attempt), so a batch never takes two.
//   4. U = scope.execute(unionSpec, D). By kind:
//        slot-busy        -> every member gets U. (The scope would report it again without
//                            waiting anyway.)
//        aborted          -> D aborted, so every member was already settled (B9).
//        ran              -> attribution per member (B7).
//        timed-out, error -> every member is "own-run".
//   5. One queue under the hold (QA-2.2-3). Own runs and rechecks run one command at a time,
//      EARLIEST DEADLINE FIRST across both kinds: at each step the member with the least
//      remaining() among those with a runnable step goes next (arrival order breaks ties). Its
//      step is either
//        - its own run (the members marked "own-run"): scope.execute(memberSpec,
//          member.deadline), whose outcome is the member's scoped outcome, verbatim; or
//        - its recheck (B8), as soon as its outcome is final (step 7).
//      So a member never waits for a step it does not need: the member with the least time left
//      runs, rechecks and settles first, and the queue never nests a scope. A member settled in
//      the meantime (an abort) is skipped, and nothing is spawned for it.
//   6. Split (QA-2.2-23): there is no union run, and this batch opens no scope. Every member runs
//      alone, as a batch of one (step 1) with its own gate's runtime: its own scope, whose hold it
//      takes under its own deadline, its own run and its own recheck. That is each member's
//      direct path, so the cost is the same as without batching, and so is every verdict, apart
//      from the time the member spent in the window (W3). The batches of one start in arrival
//      order, the order in which the members' direct hooks would have queued for the slot, and
//      each competes for the slot as its direct hook would: in parallel as far as
//      maxConcurrentVerifications allows. The split is logged once per batch. Causes: step 2a's
//      deadline check, or an inconsistent union plan (step 2).
//   7. Finality and the flaky taint (B7.5). A member's outcome is known after step 4 (derived) or
//      after its own run. It is FINAL once no taint can change it: the union was green or did not
//      run, or every union failing id is reproduced (by a finished own run or a static
//      derivation, B7.5), or no own run is left, in which case the taint is applied once. Until
//      then the member holds its outcome.
//   8. A final outcome settles AT ONCE when it needs no recheck (2.1-T2 P7: "ran" with >= 1
//      failing id and >= 1 failing file), when its reference decides it (B8.1), or when a recheck
//      already run in this batch at the same reference answers it (B8.6). Otherwise the member
//      queues for its recheck (step 5). A green member of a green union therefore settles right
//      after step 4, and a member whose own run reproduces every union failure rechecks right
//      after that run, before the own runs of members with more time left.
//   9. When the queue is empty every member is settled. Then `void scope.close()`: a requester
//      never waits for the close (2.1-T2 P9). The batch leaves the registry.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B6. UNION SPEC AND DEDUPLICATION
//
//   unionChangedFiles(M) takes each member's ChangedPath entries and resolves path and
//   previousPath against THAT member's request.cwd. ChangedPath paths may be relative to the
//   planner's cwd, and members with the same runnerCwd can have different check cwds. Entries
//   are deduplicated by the platform key of (path, previousPath), in first-seen order, keeping
//   the first entry's status (it is informational: runner.ts G.6 decides existence through the
//   fs). A file edited by two producers appears once.
//   The union is planned by planScopedRun itself (runner.ts Q 2.2), never assembled by hand. That
//   keeps argv construction, the argv-length cap, config triggers and pytest pinning in one
//   place. The step-2 consistency checks catch every way the union plan can differ from the
//   members' plans:
//     - a union-only S6: argv-too-long, too-many-searches, config-too-large;
//     - a pytest pin computed from a different common ancestor;
//     - a search that answered differently;
//     - a file that changed between the plans.
//   Each of these falls back to the split, never to a different run.
//   Cost: union planning repeats the members' test searches (git only, low priority, bounded by
//   D). Merging the members' plans instead would need a new runner.ts entry point (rejected, see
//   phase-2.2.md).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B7. ATTRIBUTION
//
//   Mode B (runner.ts J, Spike C). vitest has no non-executing related listing, and a jest-only
//   listing (mode A) was rejected. pytest needs no process at all: its spec inputs ARE the test
//   files (inputsAreTests), so a failing file belongs to the members whose inputs contain it.
//   attributeUnion(U.result, counts, memberSpec) decides for each member between "derived" (a
//   RunResult computed from the union's) and "own-run" (the member's own planScopedRun spec runs,
//   B5.5).
//   Keys: fileKeyOf(spec.cwd, abs) is the id-space file key (cwd-relative, "/" separators), the
//   construction readResult uses. fileKeyOfId(id) is 2.1-T5's rule, imported from baseline.ts
//   (2.2.3): the part before the EARLIEST " > " or "::", else the whole id, with "/" separators
//   (QA-2.2-11: a pytest name may contain " > ", as in tests/test_x.py::test_cmp[1 > 0], and its
//   file is still the part before "::"). It is the only id-to-file rule in this module (7.3a, 7.5,
//   B8.5), so the batch and 2.1's judge can never key an id differently.
//
//   7.1 Not comparable: !U.complete, U.collectionError, or U.source !== "report" -> own-run
//       (cause "not-comparable"). A vitest syntax error in any test file aborts `related` without
//       a report, which gives a text source and a collection error. Each member's own run then
//       shows whether that member hits the error alone.
//   7.2 Green union (complete, no collection error, no failing id):
//       a. A member that is not guard-sensitive -> derived green: no ids, complete, total =
//          U.total, exit 0. isGuardSensitive is false when the spec has no lexicalPaths, is not
//          inputsAreTests, and has no JS test file among its inputs (runner.ts G.8 rule). The
//          member's own related set is a subset of the union's (related is monotone in its
//          inputs, and vitest and jest run each test file in its own module scope), so its own
//          run is green too. Its own total may be 0: that is a pass with note n1 instead of
//          evidence e1, which is the same verdict.
//       b. A guard-sensitive member. Its own run would be made incomplete by readResult's
//          zero-test guard (runner.ts I 2a) if IT ran 0 tests, and the union's total cannot show
//          that. With per-file counts (counts = U.testsByFile, prerequisite P1 below):
//            inputsAreTests (pytest): n = the sum of counts over its inputs. n > 0 -> derived
//              green with total n. n = 0 -> derived incomplete with the guard's own note "<runner>
//              ran no tests although a test file was passed", which is exactly its own result.
//            JS test-file inputs (a test file given to related runs itself, runner.ts R): n = the
//              sum of counts over its test-file inputs. n > 0 -> derived green. n = 0 -> own-run
//              (cause "zero-test-ambiguous"): its source inputs may or may not have related tests.
//            lexicalPaths: as the JS rule. Keys that do not match give n = 0, hence own-run.
//          Without counts (P1 not landed, or a text source) -> own-run. This is the
//          "confirmation run".
//   7.3 Failing union (complete, no collection error, >= 1 failing id):
//       a. inputsAreTests (pytest, static attribution): ids = the U.failingIds whose file key is
//          one of the member's input keys; files = the U.failingFiles among its inputs. ids
//          non-empty -> derived, with complete, no collection error, exit 1, and total = the
//          count sum when counts exist (else U.total). ids empty -> the pytest rule of 7.2b (its
//          files all passed, or ran nothing).
//          This is only sound because the union's ids name the file that really ran each case:
//          runner.ts I step 3 maps a classname by its exact rootdir-relative path, and a classname
//          two inputs could own makes the union incomplete (7.1), never a guess (QA-2.2-1: with
//          "the first input wins", tests/test_x.py's failure landed on sub/tests/test_x.py).
//       b. vitest/jest -> own-run (cause "mode-b"). vitest cannot intersect `related` with a file
//          filter, so the member's own spec runs, covering its whole affected set. That run
//          contains exactly the failures the member would see alone.
//   7.4 So every member's final scoped outcome is one of two things. Either it is its own run's
//       outcome, verbatim. Or it is a derived "ran" outcome that judges the same: its spec is
//       the member's own spec, and its notes are the member's plan notes plus
//       "batched: 1 run for <n> requests".
//   7.5 Flaky taint (B-G2). When U had failing ids, unreproduced = U.failingIds minus the ids of
//       every finished own run and every static derivation (7.3a). A derivation counts even for
//       a member that left during the union run, because pytest attribution is exact (QA-2.2-3);
//       an own run counts even when its member left before it returned. The set only shrinks, so
//       it is decided once it is empty or no own run is left (B5.7). If it is then non-empty,
//       some union failure was reproduced by no member's own run, and taintUnreproduced makes
//       EVERY live member's "ran" result complete = false, with the note "batched run failure not
//   reproduced by any request's own run: <ids>". A complete union keeps every id (QA-2.2-11: an
//   id no derivation reproduces taints, whatever its key). Only an incomplete pytest union leaves
//   out an id that names none of its inputs (a classname readResult could not map, runner.ts I
//   step 3): its raw form cannot equal any own run's id, and every member of an incomplete union
//   runs its own spec verbatim (7.1). Per 2.1-T6, complete = false never passes (R4 u12; R2i u10 or u8), and a
//       proven introduced id still rejects (R2i x X- = F r1). The unreproduced id could belong to
//       any member's related set, and for vitest/jest a green own run cannot rule that out.
//
//   P1. Proposed write-set addition in runner.ts (task 2.2.2.a); it enables the cheap path of
//       7.2b. RunResult gains `testsByFile?: Readonly<Record<string, number>>`: the number of
//       tests the report lists for each file key, so that the values sum to total. vitest/jest:
//       assertionResults.length of each suite. pytest: the testcases mapped to each input,
//       without the collection pseudo-cases. Only report sources fill it; the text fallback
//       leaves it undefined. The change is additive, and 2.1's judgeScoped ignores it.
//       Without P1 the coordinator is still correct, but it pays one confirmation run for each
//       guard-sensitive member of a green batch. Implementation delegations usually touch test
//       files, so that would remove most of the saving.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B8. SHARED RECHECK (S2)
//
//   Only members whose scoped outcome is "ran" with >= 1 failing id and >= 1 failing file take
//   part.
//   1. Pre-decisions for each member, with no spawn (2.1-T4), in 2.1's direct-hook order:
//      ReferenceState "disabled", OR the member's own gate-time runtime.failureRecheck is off ->
//      { kind: "disabled" }; "none" -> { kind: "unusable", cause: "no-reference", reason }.
//      failureRecheck is read from the runtime of the hook that submitted the member, never from
//      the window opener's (QA-2.2-2): a reference captured at dispatch while the setting was on
//      is disabled when the setting is off at the gate (a config reload, or a later
//      router_verify), as the direct hook does.
//   2. "captured" members are grouped by referenceKey(reference): root, commit, and the sorted
//      untracked, tracked and captureReasons entries (capturedAt is excluded). A recheck at one
//      reference proves nothing about another, so ONE recheck is shared per distinct reference,
//      not per batch (deviation D3). These share one reference:
//        - the members of one dispatch (an escalation retry keeps the first reference, and
//          router_verify may name several handles of one dispatch);
//        - captures of the same clean HEAD with the same untracked files.
//      Distinct stash commits never share.
//   3. Rechecks are steps of the B5.5 queue. When a member's recheck turn comes, every member
//      ready at that moment at the same reference joins it (its group, earliest deadline first).
//      A member whose deadline.remaining() is below runtime.recheckMinRemainingMs (2.1's
//      RECHECK_MIN_REMAINING_MS, injected) gets { kind: "skipped-deadline", remainingMs } and
//      leaves its group, as it would alone (2.1-T3): a member whose budget cannot fit its
//      recheck is never passed on a guess.
//   4. A group of one member -> scope.rechecker(command, cwd, its currentTree)(reference, its
//      failingFiles, its own deadline). This is the direct path. (QA-2.2-8, 2.2.3: every recheck
//      forwards the requesting gate's tree snapshot, runtime.currentTree, as 2.1's direct hook
//      does; a shared recheck forwards its first member's.)
//   5. A group of several members:
//        files  = the deduplicated union of their failingFiles;
//        Rg     = a batch deadline over the group (B9);
//        shared = scope.rechecker(first member's command, cwd)(reference, files, Rg).
//      Each member's outcome is deriveSharedRecheck(shared, counts, its failingFiles,
//      its spec.cwd):
//        - approximate, disabled, timed-out, skipped-deadline, and unusable with a
//          reference-level cause (no-reference, materialize-failed, reference-vanished,
//          unreproduced-inputs, runner-unsupported, error) -> the same outcome for every member.
//        - unusable with a run-level cause (incomplete, collection-error, no-tests,
//          rerun-unplannable) -> "split". Another member's files may be the cause: a collection
//          error at the reference, or argv-too-long for the union list. Each member then gets
//          its own recheck (step 4), in deadline order.
//        - exact -> ranFiles and absentFiles are intersected with the member's file keys; the
//          result is filtered to the ids and files with those keys (still complete and without a
//          collection error, as "exact" requires); it is undefined when all of the member's files
//          are absent. Zero-test check, as in 7.2b:
//            with counts, a member whose ran files hold 0 tests at the reference gets unusable
//            "incomplete", because its own rerun would have tripped the rerun zero-test guard
//            (QA-1.3-17);
//            without counts, a member that has ran files but no failing id among them at the
//            reference -> "split".
//   6. Reuse (QA-2.2-3). A member that becomes ready AFTER a recheck ran at its reference (it
//      finished its own run later) first derives its outcome from each recorded outcome at that
//      reference with the rule of step 5; the first answer that is not "split" settles it with
//      no spawn. Only outcomes that hold for any member are recorded: exact, approximate, and
//      unusable "reference-vanished", "unreproduced-inputs" or "runner-unsupported". Never
//      timed-out or skipped-deadline (the deadline of the member that ran it), nor
//      "materialize-failed" (an aborted materialize reports it) or "error" (transient).
//   7. pytest: 2.1's Rechecker returns unusable "runner-unsupported" without spawning (2.1
//      decision 5), so sharing it costs nothing.
//   Recheck calls per window: at most one per distinct reference among the failing members when
//   each later member's failing files are covered by an earlier recheck at its reference, plus
//   split rechecks and rechecks of files no earlier recheck covered (at most one per member, as
//   alone). The plan's "single shared recheck" holds when the members share a reference and a
//   pre-existing failure, the plan's case.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B9. DEADLINES AND CANCELLATION
//
//   - Each member keeps its own Deadline (request.deadline: one per gate or router_verify call,
//     1.5-13). Nothing extends it.
//   - The batch deadline D = createBatchDeadline(members):
//       remaining()  the largest remaining() among the members not yet settled (0 when none);
//       bound(x)     min(x, remaining());
//       budgetMs     the largest member budget;
//       signal       aborts once every member still attached has aborted, or at dispose.
//     A settled member is released from D, so a requester that is done never keeps the batch
//     alive with its long budget. D has no timer of its own: when the last attached member's
//     signal aborts at its expiry, D aborts too. dispose() removes every listener.
//   - Which deadline bounds what:
//       union planning and the union's hold    D', D cut off where the pooled schedule stops
//                                              fitting (B5.2a, QA-2.2-25)
//       the union run                          D
//       a member's own run                     that member's deadline, exactly as alone
//       a single-member recheck                that member's deadline, exactly as alone
//       a shared recheck                       Rg, D restricted to the group
//   - A member whose signal aborts is settled at once. The result depends on its phase:
//       waiting in the window                  aborted BATCH_REASONS.window
//       union planning or union run            aborted BATCH_REASONS.run (2.1-T2 P5's phrase)
//       queued for its own run                 aborted BATCH_REASONS.attribution
//       its own run is running                 that run's outcome (the executor kills it and
//                                              reports aborted); a "ran" outcome is settled as
//                                              in the next row
//       holding a known outcome (B5.7)         QA-2.2-3: that outcome, never a bare abort. While
//                                              a union failure is still unexplained it is made
//                                              incomplete by taintUnreproduced with those ids
//                                              (never a pass); a needed recheck becomes its
//                                              reference decision, else skipped-deadline
//       final, waiting for its recheck turn    { scoped: its outcome, recheck: its reference
//                                              decision, else skipped-deadline }, as alone
//                                              below the recheck threshold
//       its recheck is running                 { scoped: its outcome, recheck: { kind:
//                                              "timed-out", boundMs: its remaining() when the
//                                              recheck started } }, as 2.1-T4.j reports an
//                                              aborted rerun
//     The member is then released from D, and the batch continues for the others.
//   - Wording (QA-2.2-9). BATCH_REASONS.beforeRun and .run are 2.1's ABORTED_BEFORE_RUN and
//     ABORTED_DURING_RUN, verbatim. A member cut during the union step gets ABORTED_DURING_RUN
//     even while the union still waits for the slot, where alone it would get slot-busy with
//     deadlineCut (u14, SLOT_DEADLINE_REASON): the scope does not expose when its first execute
//     took the hold, and the union IS the member's scoped run. Both are unverifiable (u13, u14).
//     .window and .attribution have no direct-path equivalent: those waits exist only in a batch.
//     QA-2.2-27 (nit, recorded, not changed): the solo phase it was raised against is gone with
//     QA-2.2-23. The same wording applies to the steps that remain: a member cut while a pooled
//     batch plans its union or waits for its hold (step 3) is still in phase run and gets .run,
//     as during the union run, where alone it would get slot-busy (u14); a member cut while it
//     waits behind the union for its own run (mode B) gets .attribution. A member of a split
//     starts its own run at once, in its batch of one, and so never waits in own-wait. Every
//     one of these outcomes is unverifiable (u13), as the direct path's would be.
//   - When all members have aborted, D aborts. The running execute or rechecker kills its tree
//     (exec.ts), and nothing more is spawned: an aborted signal never spawns. The batch then
//     finishes and closes its scope.
//   - A batch that runs longer than one requester's budget costs that requester an unverifiable
//     verdict at its deadline (2.1-T6 R5 u13, or u6 during the recheck). It never makes the
//     requester wait past its deadline.
//   - QA-2.2-17: under the default policy (strictUnverifiable off) such a verdict is accepted, so
//     the batch must not be what runs a member out of budget. W3 keeps each member's floor and
//     the split schedule ahead of it out of the window wait. B5.2a pools the members only when every member's budget
//     covers the worst-case batched schedule ahead of its recheck; otherwise each runs alone
//     (B5.6). W7 removes the window from a lone request altogether. What remains is an
//     estimate's error (B15).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B10. SLOT DISCIPLINE (S3, QA-1.4-18)
//
//   Each batch has one VerificationScope: runtime.openScope of the first member, with that
//   member's cwd and command as meta. The first execute takes the hold. The union run, the own
//   runs and every recheck then run inside it, one command at a time, and close() follows the
//   last of them. The coordinator never opens a scope while it waits on another (no nesting),
//   and no requester's gate waits for a batch's close. Batches for different keys hold separate
//   slots, but only as far as maxConcurrentVerifications allows (W6). A batch never waits for
//   another batch, so batches cannot deadlock each other. A split (B5.6) opens no scope and hands
//   each member to a batch of one, which holds at most one slot, as the member's direct hook
//   would; it never waits for those batches either.
//   Early-settled members (QA-2.2-5, accepted cost). A member settles as soon as its outcome is
//   final (B5.8) while its batch may still hold the slot for the other members' runs and
//   rechecks. Its gate then goes on to its next S3 check (lintClean, run, ...), which opens its
//   own scope and waits for the slot like any other verification: under
//   maxConcurrentVerifications 1 that wait lasts until the batch closes, bounded by the check's
//   slot wait and the gate deadline, so the check can end slot-busy (u14). It cannot deadlock:
//   the batch never waits on a gate or on another scope, a settled member is released from D
//   and never extends it, and every step of the batch is bounded by a remaining member's
//   deadline. Holding the member until the hold ends would spend the same wait inside testsPass
//   instead, and would give back QA-2.2-3's early settlement. 2.2.3's wiring test asserts the
//   behaviour (deferred by plan), with the order forced (QA-2.2-22). QA-2.2-17 revisits the
//   premise: that next check may end slot-busy behind its own batch where alone it could have run
//   and failed. That stays an accepted residual (B15). The wait is bounded by the batch's
//   remaining steps, which B5.2a and W3 already keep within the members' budgets, and a
//   slot-busy check is unverifiable, never a pass.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B11. MEMORY AND DISPOSAL
//
//   State:
//     - windows: a Map from key to window, each with <= maxBatchSize members and one timer;
//     - running batches: a Set;
//     - per member: the request, its plan and its resolver;
//     - the last measured run duration per batch key (W3, B5.2a), at most 64 keys (the oldest
//       is dropped), and the number of requests in planning (W7).
//   Everything else is dropped when the member settles or the batch ends. Memory is O(live
//   requests) plus that bounded map, and no window outlives its timer.
//   sweep() is called by the wiring's TTL sweep (2.2.3). It evicts defensively:
//     - windows with no live member;
//     - batches whose members are all settled but whose seam never returned (a hung executor
//       that ignored its signal) for longer than BATCH_STALE_GRACE_MS. D aborted when the last
//       member settled, so the tree was killed that long ago. The coordinator stops tracking the
//       batch and asks its scope to close, which is logged. QA-2.2-19: 2.1's scope closes only
//       once its in-flight seams have returned (deterministic.ts close()), so the slot stays
//       held until the hung seam exits. Nothing else runs beside a tree that may still be alive,
//       which is the safer behaviour, and it is kept.
//   It logs each eviction and returns the number of evictions.
//   The slot is never released before the running tree has exited (QA-2.2-4): runBatch's
//   finally closes the scope after its last seam returned, and an eviction's close waits for
//   the seam too.
//   dispose():
//     1. marks the coordinator disposed (later requests get B2.1);
//     2. clears every window timer;
//     3. settles every pending member with aborted BATCH_REASONS.disposed;
//     4. aborts every batch deadline, which kills the running trees;
//     5. awaits every running batch, that is its in-flight seam (the killed tree's exit) and
//        then its scope close, within one grace of BATCH_STALE_GRACE_MS (one timer, cleared
//        after); a batch still running after that is evicted as by sweep();
//     6. awaits the scope closes within the rest of the same grace (QA-2.2-19). A close still
//        pending after it waits for a hung seam: dispose stops waiting and logs it, and that
//        slot is released when the seam exits.
//   It is idempotent, never rejects, and returns within one grace. The default timers are
//   unref'd, so an open window never keeps the process alive.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B12. THE EQUIVALENCE PROPERTY AND ITS TEST
//
//   Statement (B-G1): for any set of requests submitted inside one window, and every member R,
//   judge(coordinator(R)) equals judge(direct(R)) on ok, on unverifiable and on the three
//   FailureClassification sets. direct(R) is the one-request path.
//   It holds under three conditions: the runner is deterministic (each file's outcome does not
//   depend on which other files run), no deadline expires, and there is no slot contention.
//   Timing outcomes (slot-busy, timed-out, aborted, skipped-deadline) are outside it, and so are
//   texts (the count in e1, notes).
//   Test (2.2.2.e, test/unit/batch.test.ts): >= 300 cases from a seeded PRNG (mulberry32, as in
//   test/unit/guards.test.ts).
//     - Fake repo: sources S and test files T; related(s) is a subset of T, and every test file
//       relates to itself. Each test file has a test count >= 0 and a failing set, both now and
//       at each reference; some files are absent at a reference. The runner is vitest-like
//       (related) or pytest-like (inputs are tests). Change sets are random and may overlap.
//       References are random too: shared or distinct, captured, none or disabled.
//     - Fake seams, each counting its calls:
//         plan: inputs = the existing changed files; S6 for a trigger file; NoAffected for none.
//         openScope: execute returns the model's RunResult, applies readResult's zero-test guard
//           and fills testsByFile; rechecker returns exact/absent/ran from the model.
//     - direct(R) is the test's own one-request path over the same seams.
//     - judge: until 2.2.3, an oracle of 2.1-T5/T6 written in the test; from 2.2.3 on, 2.1's
//       judgeScoped as well, and both must agree.
//     - Each case asserts: equal judgements; exactly one scope per batch; spawns within the
//       cost model (B13); no leaked timers after dispose (vi.getTimerCount() === 0).
//   A flaky variant adds a failure that appears only in the union run, and asserts B-G2: no
//   member judges ok.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B13. COST MODEL (spawns through the argv seam, per window of n members)
//
//   green union, P1 present           1 scoped run, +1 for each zero-test-ambiguous member (7.2b)
//   green union, P1 absent            1 + the number of guard-sensitive members
//   pytest, failing, report complete  1 scoped run; rechecks spawn nothing (runner-unsupported)
//   vitest/jest, failing              1 + n scoped runs (mode B), + 1 recheck per distinct
//                                     reference among the failing members when later members'
//                                     files are covered (B8.6), else up to 1 per member
//   split (union inconsistent, or     n scoped runs and n scopes, as without batching (B5.6)
//     the B5.2a deadline check)
//   n = 1                             exactly the direct path (W7: no window wait when alone)
//   The plan's acceptance criterion, "<= 1 scoped run + <= 1 recheck per window", is asserted on
//   the green and pytest paths and with a shared reference. On the vitest/jest failing path the
//   test asserts 1 + n runs and one recheck per distinct reference (deviation D2).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B14. DEVIATIONS FROM THE PLAN
//
//   D1 The batch key adds file, cwd and the argv template (B3).
//   D2 On a failing vitest/jest union, mode B spends n attribution runs, so the plan's "<= 1
//      scoped run per window" holds on the green and static paths only. Mode B's per-request run
//      is the request's own planScopedRun spec, not "only the failing files": `related` cannot
//      be intersected with a file filter (runner.ts J).
//   D3 One shared recheck per distinct reference, not one per batch (B8.2).
//   D4 The maximum window size is a coordinator option (BATCH_MAX_REQUESTS = 8), not a config
//      key. config.ts and the section 1.4 surface are outside 2.2's write set, and the value
//      only bounds the worst-case slot hold (1 + 8 runs).
//   D5 A guard-sensitive member of a green batch needs per-file counts (P1, runner.ts) or a
//      confirmation run.
//   D6 One coordinator exists per plugin instance, but it receives its runtime per gate
//      (hook(runtime)). A config reload therefore reaches new windows without a new coordinator.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// B15. RESIDUAL RISKS (accepted; QA may challenge)
//
//   - Cross-file state. pytest runs all of the union's files in one process, so a test that
//     pollutes another file's state can change outcomes compared with a run alone. vitest and
//     jest isolate each file by default; a config that turns isolation off carries the same
//     risk. A failure caused by pollution makes the member unverifiable, because pytest failures
//     are never proven introduced (2.1 decision 5). Pollution that hides a failure is a risk the
//     user's own suite run has too.
//   - Flaky tests on the own-run path. A failure that appears only in a member's own run is
//     judged exactly as it would be alone (2.1-T11's flaky row).
//   - Distinct stash commits never share a recheck, even when their trees are identical. A
//     tree-hash key would need git at capture time, which is out of scope.
//   - A config reload in the middle of a window keeps the opener's window length and scope
//     options.
//   - Deadline estimates (QA-2.2-17, B-G7). W3 and B5.2a rely on the key's last measured run
//     duration, with a recheck estimated as one more run and a union as one run per member.
//       - Before the first measured run of a key in a plugin instance, e is 0: the first
//         concurrent window of a key pools any member that has its floor, and a failing
//         vitest/jest union can still cost a tight member its recheck there (the QA's R5 with
//         every gate in one window). A lone gate (W7), or any earlier batch of the key, measures
//         e. The first window of a key was not made to split by default: that would give up the
//         saving of every first fan-out.
//       - A member's own run slower than the last measured run, or a recheck slower than a run
//         (materialize), can exceed the estimate by more than BATCH_RESERVE_MARGIN_MS.
//       - The first run of a scope includes its slot wait. That only overstates e, and costs
//         batching, not verdicts, until the next measurement. A union's run also measures e, and
//         a union is at least as long as one own run, so it too only overstates it.
//       - Union planning and the union's slot wait are bounded by D' (B5.2a); a planner step that
//         does not honour its deadline's bound can still overrun it, and the check after planning
//         then splits a batch that is already late.
//   - The window itself (W3). Under a first-come slot, a request that queues while a member waits
//     in its window is served before that member, where the member's direct hook would have
//     queued first. W3 keeps the member's split schedule out of the wait, but not the runs of such
//     later requests. The wait is bounded by batchWindowMs (at most a tenth of the gate budget,
//     QA-2.2-21), and W7 removes it when nothing else is in flight in the coordinator.
//   - Serial runs under one hold. With maxConcurrentVerifications > 1, the direct path could run
//     members in parallel where a batch runs their own runs and rechecks one at a time. B5.2a
//     pools only when each member's worst case fits its own budget, whatever the slot count, and
//     a split runs every member in its own scope, in parallel as far as the slots allow.
//   - QA-2.2-5 (B10): an early-settled member's next S3 check may end slot-busy behind its own
//     batch where alone it could have run.

// B16. IMPLEMENTATION TASKS (each <= ~20 tool calls; commit and push each one green)
//
//   2.2.2 runs on vrb/p22, in parallel with 2.1.2-2.1.6. It does not touch wiring.ts, index.ts or
//   deterministic.ts. Tests run scoped: npx vitest run test/unit/batch.test.ts.
//   2.2.2.a runner.ts P1, only with the orchestrator's approval of the write-set addition;
//           otherwise skip it and keep the confirmation-run path. readResult fills
//           RunResult.testsByFile for JSON and junit reports. Tests in test/unit/runner.test.ts
//           on the Spike C reports in test/fixtures/runner/reports: the sum equals total, the
//           text fallback leaves it undefined, and pytest pseudo-cases are excluded.
//   2.2.2.b batch.ts pure helpers: envSignature, argvTemplate, batchKey, referenceKey,
//           unionChangedFiles, isGuardSensitive, fileKeyOf, attributeUnion, deriveSharedRecheck,
//           taintUnreproduced and createBatchDeadline. Table tests for each:
//             - win32 and posix keys;
//             - relative ChangedPath resolution;
//             - every attributeUnion row;
//             - every deriveSharedRecheck kind and cause;
//             - D's release, abort and dispose, with no listener left behind.
//   2.2.2.c createBatchCoordinator core: B2 bypasses, W1-W6, B5 steps 1-4 and 6, B9 and B11, with
//           injected timers and clock. Tests (fake timers):
//             - 5 requests -> 1 union run and 5 results;
//             - different keys -> separate scopes;
//             - window 0 -> direct;
//             - an arrival during a running batch -> the next window;
//             - max size closes the window early; so does W3;
//             - an abort in the window;
//             - one member aborts mid-run -> the others still get results;
//             - all abort -> the execute seam sees an aborted signal, and nothing is spawned
//               afterwards;
//             - dispose -> 0 timers, pending requests settled;
//             - the hook never rejects when a seam throws.
//   2.2.2.d attribution and recheck: B5 steps 5 and 7-9, B7 and B8. Tests:
//             - the union fails in a file of one member -> only that member's own run fails;
//             - a failing file shared by two members -> both are rechecked;
//             - a pre-existing failure shared by all members with one reference -> one recheck,
//               and every member derives "exact";
//             - distinct references -> one recheck each;
//             - a run-level unusable recheck -> split;
//             - skipped-deadline below the threshold;
//             - the flaky taint;
//             - pytest static attribution, with and without counts;
//             - deduplication of an overlapping change set.
//   2.2.2.e the property test (B12), coverage >= 90% of batch.ts lines and branches, and the QA
//           report section in phase-2.2.md.
//   2.2.3 starts after 2.1 is merged into vrb/wave-2. It writes wiring.ts, whose only writer it is
//   at that point.
//   2.2.3.a wiring.ts:
//             - one coordinator per plugin instance (createBatchCoordinator);
//             - per gate, runtime = {
//                 direct: 2.1's createDirectTestsPassHook(...),
//                 plan: planScopedRun with the gate's PlannerFs, a TestSearchSeam bound to the
//                   given deadline, the budget and the host,
//                 openScope: 2.1's scope opener,
//                 batchWindowMs: budget.batchWindowMs,
//                 recheckMinRemainingMs: RECHECK_MIN_REMAINING_MS };
//             - buildGateDeps' testsPass hook becomes coordinator.hook(runtime);
//             - the existing TTL sweep also calls coordinator.sweep();
//             - plugin disposal, if the host offers one, calls dispose().
//           batch.ts: replace the private idFileKey with 2.1's fileKeyOfId.
//           Done (2.2.3): wiring.ts creates the coordinator in createVerificationWiring. With
//           batchWindowMs > 0, buildGateDeps' testsPass is coordinator.hook(runtime), and 2.1's
//           direct hook stays as runtime.direct; with batchWindowMs <= 0 the direct hook is used
//           as is. The runtime shares the direct hook's opener, PlannerFs and budget, and adds
//           the gate-time failureRecheck and the gate's tree (QA-2.2-8: BatchRuntime.currentTree,
//           OpenBatchScope). index.ts's idle-TTL sweeper calls sweepVerification() (the
//           coordinator's sweep), and plugin dispose awaits disposeVerification().
//           QA-2.2-21: the runtime's batchWindowMs is effectiveBatchWindowMs(budget), that is
//           min(batchWindowMs, gateBudgetMs / 10): 2000 ms at the defaults.
//   2.2.3.b test/unit/batch-wiring.test.ts, with 5 concurrent testsPass gates through
//           buildGateDeps:
//             - the argv seam sees 1 scoped run per window (+ <= 1 recheck with a shared
//               reference) on the green and pytest paths, and 1 + n on the vitest failing path;
//             - verdicts equal those with batchWindowMs: 0;
//             - the B12 property with 2.1's judgeScoped next to the oracle;
//             - one slot acquisition per batch, never nested.
